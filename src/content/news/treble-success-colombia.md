BiYu Promotions celebrates a triumphant weekend in Colombia as three of its rising prospects – **Chavon Davis**, **Rafael Abreu**, and **Eliesel Rodriguez Ledesma** – all extended their unbeaten records with impressive victories, showcasing the depth and quality of talent being developed by the Houston-based promotional company.

The triple success demonstrates BiYu Promotions' commitment to providing international opportunities for its fighters while building their experience against quality opposition in hostile environments.

## Perfect Knockout Streak Continues

**Light heavyweight prospect Chavon Davis (5-0, 5 KOs)** continued his perfect knockout streak with another devastating performance, maintaining his 100% finishing rate that has made him one of the most feared punchers in his division. The Ohio native's power-punching display further enhanced his reputation as a future title contender.

## Aggressive Style on Display

**Junior middleweight Rafael Abreu (5-0, 4 KOs)** showcased the aggressive, come-forward style that has drawn comparisons to former super middleweight champion David Benavidez. The 20-year-old Dominican prospect's relentless pressure and heavy hands overwhelmed his Colombian opponent, extending his professional winning streak.

## Versatile Power Puncher

**Featherweight Eliesel "El Guardia" Rodriguez Ledesma (3-0, 3 KOs)** delivered another stunning knockout performance, adding to his perfect professional record since turning professional in December 2024. The 22-year-old former Dominican Republic Air Force paratrooper and three-time Copa Independencia champion continues to impress with his versatility and devastating power from both orthodox and southpaw stances.

> "To have three fighters compete internationally and all return victorious is a testament to the preparation and dedication of our entire team. These victories in Colombia show that our fighters are ready to compete anywhere in the world. Each of these young men showed tremendous heart and skill in hostile territory."

**Bobby Harrison, CEO of BiYu Promotions**

## International Development Strategy

The Colombian campaign represents part of BiYu Promotions' strategic approach to developing fighters through challenging international competition. By exposing prospects to different styles and environments, the company ensures its fighters are battle-tested and ready for championship-level competition.

"Fighting in Colombia was an incredible experience," said Rodriguez Ledesma. "The fans there are passionate about boxing, and it pushed me to perform at my best. These international fights are making me a more complete fighter."

All three fighters are expected to return to action on BiYu Promotions events in Houston over the coming months, with each positioned for significant step-up opportunities based on their continued development and impressive performances.

The success in Colombia follows BiYu Promotions' established pattern of carefully developing prospects through a combination of domestic and international competition, ensuring fighters are prepared for world-level competition when championship opportunities arise.
