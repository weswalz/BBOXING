BiYu Promotions is proud to announce the signing of undefeated cruiserweight prospect Chavon "Silent Assassin" Stillwell, a big-hitting fighter who has been tipped for world title contention. The powerful southpaw brings exceptional skill and devastating knockout power to BiYu's growing roster of champions.

The 25-year-old Ohio native has relocated to Houston to train under renowned coach Rene Vasquez at the state-of-the-art BiYu Training Complex. Stillwell's professional journey has been marked by his extraordinary punching power, having secured knockouts in his first four professional fights during his time with Premier Boxing Champions.

> "Chavon represents everything we look for in a fighter. He has the power, the dedication, and the hunger to reach the very top of the cruiserweight division. We've seen him in training, and his punching power is truly devastating. He's earned his nickname 'Silent Assassin' because he lets his fists do the talking."

**Bobby Harrison, CEO of BiYu Promotions**

After an 18-month layoff, Stillwell made his comeback in April 2024, demonstrating that his time away from the ring has only sharpened his focus and determination. The southpaw's aggressive style and technical improvements under Vasquez's guidance have impressed the BiYu Promotions team.

"I'm excited to be part of the BiYu family," said Stillwell. "Bobby Harrison and his team believe in me, and they're giving me the opportunity to show the world what I can do. I've been working harder than ever, and I'm ready to make my mark in the cruiserweight division."

## Upcoming Fights

Stillwell is scheduled to compete for the ABO Cruiserweight title against Nicholas Molina on September 6 in Edinburg, Texas, before headlining the upcoming BiYu Brawl event in Houston on October 10. The signing represents BiYu Promotions' continued commitment to identifying and developing elite talent overlooked by major promotions.

With his combination of natural power, improved technical skills, and renewed focus, Stillwell is positioned to become a major force in the cruiserweight division within the next two years.
