BiYu Promotions announced that three of its premier fighters will compete on the highly anticipated "Gloves & Glory" card, scheduled for September 6, 2024, at the Bert Ogden Arena in Edinburg, Texas. The joint venture between BiYu Promotions and Marquez Promotions promises to deliver world-class boxing action to the Rio Grande Valley.

## Main Event: Garcia vs Hernandez

Headlining BiYu's presence on the card is Dominican Republic super featherweight **Eridson Garcia (20-1, 12 KOs)**, who will challenge Cristian Perez Hernandez (12-2) for the prestigious **WBO NABO Super Featherweight title** in a scheduled 10-round bout. Garcia, currently ranked 13th by the WBA, returns to championship-level competition after extensive preparation at the BiYu Training Complex in Houston.

> "This is exactly the type of opportunity we work to create for our fighters. Eridson has been developing specific techniques and strategies for this title fight. He's ready to show the boxing world that he belongs at the championship level."

**Bobby Harrison, CEO of BiYu Promotions**

## Supporting Bouts

Also featured on the card is unbeaten cruiserweight prospect **Chavon Stillwell (6-0, 6 KOs)**, who will face Houston-based Nicholas Molina (7-3-1) for the **ABO Cruiserweight title** in an eight-round contest. The Ohio native, known as the "Silent Assassin," has relocated to Houston and has been impressive in training under Rene Vasquez.

Completing the BiYu trio is Dominican Republic featherweight **Erick Rosado (15-3, 10 KOs)**, who takes on unbeaten Adolfo Alanis (6-0) in a challenging six-round bout. Rosado, making his continued push in American boxing, faces his toughest test against the undefeated prospect.

## Broadcast Details

The event will be broadcast live on **Box Azteca America** and **TV Azteca Texas**, providing national exposure for all BiYu Promotions fighters. The partnership with legendary four-division world champion Juan Manuel Marquez adds significant credibility and attention to the event.

"Having three fighters on such a prestigious card demonstrates the depth of talent we're developing at BiYu Promotions," Harrison added. "Each fighter brings their unique style and story, and all three are ready to deliver exciting performances for the fans in Edinburg."
