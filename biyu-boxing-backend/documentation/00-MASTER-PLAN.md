2. **User Testing**: Can a non-technical person use it?
3. **Performance Testing**: Is it fast enough?
4. **Security Testing**: Are there any vulnerabilities?
5. **Mobile Testing**: Does it work on tablets/phones?

### Testing Checkpoints:
- ✅ **Daily**: Test current feature works
- ✅ **End of Phase**: Full regression test
- ✅ **Pre-deployment**: Complete system test
- ✅ **Post-deployment**: Production verification
