          <p class="mb-4">
            Super featherweight <strong>Eridson Garcia</strong> (20-1) has revealed he has upped his preparations ahead of his headline WBO NABO title fight against Cristian Perez Hernandez (12-2) on Saturday September 6.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">
            The duo go head-to-head on the <strong>Gloves & Glory</strong> card being held at the Bert Ogden Arena in Edinburg, TX. The show, a joint venture between Marquez Promotions and BiYu Promotions, will be broadcast live on Box Azteca America and TV Azteca Texas.
          </p>
          
          <p class="mb-4">
            The Dominican Republic southpaw, ranked 13th by the WBA, has been working on specific areas while training in Houston ahead of the 10-round fight against his Mexican opponent.

            "I've been developing some of my punches to work on in the fight. You can expect to see more development from me and you'll be able to see my skills and my performance in the ring. I have been doing everything necessary to come out with the victory on September 6th."
          </blockquote>
          
          <p class="mb-4">
