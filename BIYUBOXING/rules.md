**RULES FOR CLAUDE**
1. Only follow exact request and do not run with any process outside of what was asked.  If you think something is absolutely needed, then ask before proceeding.
2. Do not install any dependency or plugin or addon that was not asked for without expressed consent from the engineer.
3. Use the latest stable release of all dependencies but before installation do research using fetch or brave search to ensure conflicts will not arise.  If you find something, bring it up to the engineer before proceeding.
4. Do not output long drawn out responses.  I only need to know if the task was done or not.  And if not then why.
5. Make sure to use intelligent commenting but not excessively.
6. Enable and utilize logging and reference the logging while building to keep things functional as you work.
7. Always approach every situation with a top down, analytical forenzic approach.  No bandaid fixes.  No quick fixes. Any change needs to make sense across the codebase.
8. Keep all files under 500 lines of code and refactor when needed. 
9. No excessive notes and scripts and guides that were not requested. 
10. Research is encouraged to make sure youre up to date on whats being requested but also make sure you only search official documentation unless its a unique situation that requires social forums and things like that.
11. All UI updates must be done with 2025 award winning web design in mind and the sites you make would be potential candidates for awwwards.com.
12. No design elements or sections or pages will be created that were not requested unless youre asked to be creative and come up with something.
13. While you build, keep SEO in mind and do whats needed to keep page titles and relevant things up to date with what will best suite the brand.
