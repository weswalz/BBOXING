Dominican Republic super featherweight **Eridson Garcia (19-1, 12 KOs)** is ready to make a statement when he headlines the inaugural BiYu Brawl event in Houston, marking his return to the ring after nine months of intensive preparation and strategic career planning.

The 30-year-old southpaw, ranked **#14 by the WBA**, will face Nicaraguan challenger Jeovanny Antonio Tellez (13-2, 9 KOs) in an eight-round main event at Club Hefe on Saturday, April 26, 2025. The bout represents Garcia's final fight under the BiYu Promotions banner before transitioning to a new promotional arrangement while remaining under Bobby Harrison's management.

## Strategic Preparation Period

> "This fight is about more than just getting back in the ring. I've been working on specific aspects of my game during this time away, and I'm ready to show the boxing world that I'm prepared for the biggest opportunities. You can expect to see a more developed, more skilled version of me."

Garcia's nine-month layoff has been strategically used to refine his technical skills and prepare for what promises to be the next phase of his career. The Dominican boxer has been linked to a recently announced boxing league that aims to revolutionize the sport's landscape.

## Future Ambitions

"I have no idea what they intend to do as it is a new company, but I hope it will be something big and I'm going all out," Garcia explained. "I would like to be offered the biggest challenges to fulfill my goals and dreams. I still have a lot of desire to be the world champion in different divisions â€“ more desire than when I started my career."

**Bobby Harrison, CEO of BiYu Promotions**, expressed confidence in Garcia's readiness for this pivotal moment in his career: "Eridson has used this time away wisely. He's been dedicated to improving every aspect of his game, and he's ready to put down a marker that shows he belongs at the world level."

## Inaugural BiYu Brawl Concept

The inaugural **BiYu Brawl** represents a new concept in boxing entertainment, combining world-class competition with an intimate club atmosphere at Houston's premier entertainment venue. The event will be livestreamed on **BiYuBoxing.com**, providing fans worldwide access to Garcia's highly anticipated return.

Garcia's last outing was a decision victory over William Foster III in July 2024, and he's eager to remind the boxing world of his capabilities as he positions himself for major opportunities in 2025.

## Fan Connection

"The fans in Houston have always supported me, and I want to give them a performance they'll remember," Garcia said. "This is about showing everyone that I'm ready for whatever comes next in my career. I've been preparing for this moment, and I won't let it pass by."
